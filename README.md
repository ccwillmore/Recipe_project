## Group 8 Final Project

## Selected Topic
We have chosen to look at different recipes to examine any patterns that may occur in ingredients within certain cuisines and then to dig deeper, into how they are grouped in those recipes.

## Reason they selected the topic
The idea is to provide a resource to the everyday cook that can simply tell you what might taste good together, based on the frequency that they are used together in recipes. Someone might be able to discern that when making a mexican dish, cumin, lime and chili powder are frequently paired together but never occur in a recipe with lemongrass.

## Description of the source of data
We are using the recipe API from Spoonacular, the dataset is well organized and has a lot of information.

## Questions they hope to answer with the data
Which ingredients occur the most frequently in the following cuisines: Thai, Italian, Mexican, Chinese, Greek? Which ingredients most commonly appear together within the recipes within each cuisine?
